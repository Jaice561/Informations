# Informations
Options
Information is a website where the user will be able to send 
information to another page for the manager or the owner to view. 
This information will not be available to public eyes, 
the only person who would know or have access is if they know where to go.

For now I tried to focus on the back-end more, but I will soon work on the front-end
